# This is a sample udev rules file that demonstrates how to get udev to
# set the name of IPoIB interfaces to whatever you wish.  There is a
# 16 character limit on network device names.
#
# Important items to note: ATTR{type}=="32" is IPoIB interfaces, and the
# ATTR{address} match must start with ?* and only reference the last 8
# bytes of the address or else the address might not match the variable QPN
# portion.
#
# Modern udev is case sensitive and all addresses need to be in lower case.
